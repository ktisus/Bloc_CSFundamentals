1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
var names = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]

b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.
names.push(“Mary”)

c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).

function findJosh () {
	return names.indexOf(‘Josh’)
}

d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?

function findEmily () {
	If (names.includes(‘Emily’)) {
		return “Name found”
   }
   else {
   	return “Name not found”
   }
}

e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?

names.splice(1, 0, ‘Melissa’)

	f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?	

names.splice(3, 1)

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.
Such as managing food in refrigerator.

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
Developers can access data by using index of data and manipulate like add, remove, or find the food by using some array methods.
